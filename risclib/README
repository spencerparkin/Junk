This directory contains a simple and far
from complete library of functions for
RISC assembly language programmers and
proposed solutions to all exam questions
in the book: Introduction to RISC Assembly Language,
by John Waldron.  I've done my best to solve
each exam question to fit all test cases.  These
solutions are implemented as real-world running
programs.  The code will not work with SPIM.  Also note
that these programs are non-shared and don't include
the appropriate pseudo-ops for gdb.  Oops!  The
exams along with the test programs provided
demonstrate the usage of the library.

The library was originally compiled on a
PlayStation2 MIPS R5900 (EE Core).  With luck,
it should compile on your MIPS platform.  Just
type 'make'.  Then, to build the exams and tests,
type 'make examples'.
