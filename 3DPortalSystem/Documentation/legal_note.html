<h1>Legal Note</h1>

This program cannot be freely distributed as it uses texture data I ripped-off from
the internet and features pictures of celebrities without their expressed permission.
Also, a copy of the GNU public licence and other legal crap aren't provided, though
a copy of GLUT and TIFF are.  This program was only meant for personal use and to
be handed into a professor for brief review, followed by swift disposal.<p>
