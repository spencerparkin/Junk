The project got too big, but there's no reason to be afraid of that,
because here I'm going to point out only what is pertinent
to this assignment.  That is, the main data-structure used,
and the main algorithms performed on it.  But first, a small overview of
the project is provided that will define some terminology
used by the program code.  Without reading this first, my descriptions of the
graph data structure and algorithms that follow may not make sense.
<b>I realize I've written a lot here.
I have marked with an '*' sections that you can skip for the sake of
saving time.  In general, don't feel obligated to read any of this if
you don't have time or don't want to.  That's not to say it isn't worth reading;
I'm just saying that I tend to ramble on and on and...you get the point.</b>

<h3>Quick comment...</h3>

The term "propagate" was used in this documentation and in the source code, but
after finally looking up the word in the dictionary, I see now that it was not
the correct word to use.  I thought the word simply meant to move from one place
to another.  But it really has to do with expanding the presents of something from
one place to a larger area.  I just found all this out before turning the
assignment in.  I hope that this clears things up.  Sorry 'bout that.
