<h1>Concluding Remarks</h1>

The problems of visible surface determination and collision detection/resolution
are perhaps the two hardest and most prominant in computer graphics programming,
and they are certainly related to one another.  In the case of this program,
the same data-structure was used by the algorithms that performed each of
these functions.  While the program addmittedly has many glitches,
(and is quite frankly a peice of junk), I believe I can say that the
program was a success for at least three reasons.
First, the mathematical theory developped for FOVI objects 
which was put into practice here was made procise enough to
let the program successfully perform VSD.  The program would
otherwise have been unusuable on slow machines such as my own.
Second, there was a lot of thought put into the mathematics of
2D collision detection, which ideas may extend to 3D collision detection.
Lastly, and generally, and most importantly, this program hopefully
serves as a stepping stone to more advanced programs in computer graphics,
which, in my opinion, are the most interesting and fun programs to write.

<h2>The next version of this program.</h2>

The next program is even more ambitious, but the lessons I've
learned here in writing this program, I believe, will be invaluable,
and will make the program a possibility.
The next program will be built on a thoroughly tested and proven
foundation of mathematical routines to perform intersection tests
between fundamental geometrical objects and routines that can resolve those
collisions.  These routines would be the basis for a collision
detection engine built around the idea of the spacial partitioning
matrix.  Some sort of modeling software must be employed to rapidly
produce and export geometrical data that the program or a program
in a tool-chain can process before rendering it.
Ideally I would be able to find one on the internet, or if not, right
a primitive program that will do the job.<p>

The next program will not be limited topologicaly to two dimensions.
It will allow a character to traverse a world with inclined planes, drop-offs,
bridges, tunnels, etc.  I'll probably switch to an out-door environment and
deal less rigorously with VSD.  Back-face
culling and the Z-buffer will do fine, and something simple could be done to test
for and determine if large portions of the scene are visible to the
camera or not.  The main focus of this program would be to demonstrate
perfect collision detection and resolution with all surfaces in a
gravity environement.  A graph data structure
might be used on a much larger scale or perhaps a BSP tree to indicate
which large sections of the scene are visible to the camera from
general perspectives.</p>
