<h1>Brief Source File Explinations</h1>
What follows is a brief explination of
each source code module.  It's meant more as
a reference than anything else.  <b>Skip this if
you don't have time to read it.</b></p>
<li>artifact.cpp -- Impliments base class functionality for objects of type "Artifact".
<li>blob.cpp -- Impliments the "Blob" entity.
This entity uses tethers to track its target.
<li>buffer.cpp -- Provides a simple buffer
facility for inserting and removing data
for arrays of pointers.  The data structure
and algorithms are very slow in theory, but
very fast in practice because the buffers
are all very tiny.
<li>camera.cpp -- Impliments the camera entity.
This is also where the viewing matrix is
setup and the scene rendering algorithm begins.
<li>cell.cpp -- Impliments the "Cell" object.
This is the basic element or node of the scene
graph.  A part of the indirectly recursive
scene drawing algorithm can be found here.
<li>door.cpp -- Impliments doors between
adjacent cells.  Doors animate when they open
and close.
<li>fovi.cpp -- This module houses all of the
mathematics associated with FOVIs (fields of vision)
in the XY-plane.
These fundamental geometrical objects, and
the operations that may be performed upon them,
form the critical foundation upon which the
visible surface determination algorithm is built.
This algorithm is used to draw the visible parts
of the elements of the scene graph.
<li>healthpack.cpp -- Impliments the health-pack
artifacts which may be used once by entities
to rejuvinate their health.
<li>hud.cpp -- This module is responsible for
rendering the heads-up-display for a given
entity.
<li>key.cpp -- Impliments the key artifact.
These can be collected by entities and used
to open specific doors.
<li>levelX.cpp -- These files (X=1,2,3,4) define
the 4 level maps stored as arrays of map constructs.
<li>line.cpp -- This file, like fovi.cpp, is a
very important file.  It houses all of the
mathematics associated with line-segments in
the XY-plane.  Much of the math used
by the collision detection/resolution code
is in this file.  Math operations involving
tests and operations between lines and FOVIs
are put here and also in fovi.cpp as well,
depending on which has larger context.
<li>LL.cpp -- This file provides support for
quick and limited, doubly-linked lists, which
are used in various parts of the program.
I didn't need anything fancy.  I just needed
what little I wrote in this file.
<li>main.cpp -- This module houses the main
subroutine (the starting point of the program).
It deals mostly with GLUT and the user interface
programming, which is keyed to a given entity,
which is always the instance of the "Spencer"
entity.
<li>map.cpp -- This file contains the map
loader code.  It is responsible for building
the scene graph data structure, and tairing
it down at end-of-level.
<li>orb.cpp -- Impliments the orb artifact.
These are collected by entities at end-of-level
and to trigger end-of-level.
<li>portal.cpp -- Impliments the portal surface.
These are the edges of the scene graph.  Parts
of the indirectly recursive drawing algorithm
can be found here, as well as how the FOVI
clipping takes place.
<li>random.cpp -- Provides simple routines
for generating random numbers.  The option to
provide a specific seed is nice for bug
reproduction.
<li>snowman.cpp -- Impliments the snow-man
entity.  These entities are programmed to
track a preset target when visible.
<li>spencer.cpp -- Impliments the spencer
entity.  Only once instance is ever
instantiated.  This entity is controlled by
the user.
<li>surface.cpp -- Impliments the "Surface"
base class object.  These are the fundamental
drawable objects of the scene graph, and whose
visibility is easily determinable.  Therefore,
so is the visibility of all the types of
objects derived from
this class that inherit this functionality.
<li>switch.cpp -- Impliments the wall switches.
These may be switched on/off by entities.
<li>teleport.cpp -- Impliments teleports.
These appear as circular disks on floors
representing a telepad.  Only one of these
appears in level3, I believe.  They teleport
an entity acting upon it from one cell to
another.
<li>tether.cpp -- Provides a way to keep
track of a path through the scene graph
connecting two given entities.  This is
used by the 3rd person camera and snow men.
<li>texture.cpp -- This module provides
support for loading and managing texture data,
as well as provides convenience routines for
making applying those textures to polygons
easier to do.
<li>wall.cpp -- Impliments "Wall" objects
which are types of surfaces.  The major goal
of the 3D portal system is to determine which
walls are visible and which are not when
drawing the scene.<p>

Whew!  That's it!<p>
