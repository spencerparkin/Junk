<h1>Notes on Compilation</h1>
First off, you shouldn't have to compile the project.  But if
you want to, it <i>should</i> compile for you with zero errors
and zero warnings since all of the static import libraries
are provided for and relatively pointed to by the project file.
Also, all of the support DLLs are located in the same directory as
the executable where they can be found at run-time.
I have compiled and ran the program on the computers at school and
it worked great for me there.  (Especially because the school computers
are much-much faster than my computer at home.)
The project was compiled using MS Visual C++ 6, so I'm not sure
what's required to get it compiling under some other windows compiler.
Note that the program will barf on start-up if it can't find the
texture-data directory.  It can find it from its default location,
so don't move the executable anywhere else with respect to the
project's directory tree.  Move the entire project directory tree
instead.  If you have trouble running the program, please E-mail me at
"spencerparkin@mail.weber.edu".  It should run right out of the box.
If it doesn't, then I'm an idiot.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Heaven willing, the program will run for you.  
When it does,
you may use the arrow keys or the mouse to navigate.  Hold
the ALT-key down to strafe.  The arrow
keys are clunky, (since I'm using GLUT and not getting
real-time leading-edge and trailing-edge key-state information),
and the mouse works only when the left-button is held down
inside the window, (since I'm using GLUT instead of grabbing
the mouse pointer.)
The default camera mode is 1st person.  Push the 'C' button
on your keyboard to toggle 3rd person mode.  This mode is
very unpleasent, as you will no doubt notice.  It's got some bugs.  Push the 'O'
button to toggle topological mode.  This gives you some insight
into the geometry of the map and how it is internally represented.
I used this heavily while debugging.  In this mode you will
be able to see the different fields of vision generated by
the VSD (Visible Surface Determination) algorithm as it recursively
traverses the scene graph drawing the scene.  Push the 'Q' button to
cheat.  This makes you involnurable to attack and allows you
to open any door.  To open a door or pick up an artifact, press
the space bar while near the object and directly facing it.
The proximity test is a bit finicky, so don't give up on the
first try.  <b>See if you can complete all 4 levels
without cheating, peaking at the "levelX.cpp" files, or
modifying the program.</b>
Nothing is displayed when the game ends
by you dying or completing the game.  This is sad; I know.
Push the 'A' button in any camera mode to toggle the VSD
algorithm on and off.  You should notice a significant hit in frame-rate
when VSD is off.  I certainly do on my computer and so it
was well worth the effort, I think, to develop the VSD algorithm.<p>

The first thing you may
notice when the game comes up is that it's missing sound.
It really needs sound.  Oh well.  Press the ESC-key at
any time to quit the program.  Press F1 to cheat yet again
and warp to the next level.  <b>If at any point the program
stops responding, check the DOS-prompt output window for
an error message.  If there is one, you can cleanly exit
the program.  If there isn't one, heaven forbid, you'll
have to just kill the process.  The program locking
up should be a rare occurance, but it does happen.</b><p>

The heads-up-display, (referenced as the HUD in code comments),
currently only gives you two peices of information.  The first
is your life bar at the bottom of the screen, and the second
is the frame-rate you're getting.
On my system, changing the initial window size ruins the
frame-rate, even if I resize the window back to its original
size.  I'm not sure if this will be the same for you or not.
But in general, the smaller your window is, the better frame
rate you'll get.  Play around with this.  See how good of a
frame-rate you can get with the window really big.  The program
uses OpenGL texture objects, so it will take advantage of
resident texture memory on your video card if you have a nice
graphics card and an implimentation of OpenGL on your system
that is programmed to use it.
Again, since the program uses OpenGL, it should also take advantage
of any other OpenGL hardware acceleration supported by your graphics card.
In pratice I think it would be better to do away with the window
and find a way to take over the entire screen and set it to
a decent resolution.  But I don't know how to do this yet.<p>
