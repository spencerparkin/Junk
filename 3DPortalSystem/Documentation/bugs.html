<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
There are several known bugs in the project.  The ones that
I can remember are enumerated here.  <b>Do not read this if you don't have time
or simply don't want to.</b>  I added this page because I felt it was an important
peice of documentation of the project.<p>

<h2>Functional Bugs</h2>

<li>The VSD drawing algorithm for the floor and ceiling has some clipping
bugs in it when a cell is viewed from outside of it.
<li>Walls and cells too far away may not draw due to round-off error
when the current field of vision gets clipped too small.
<li>Some non-visible walls draw due to round-off error when an end-point
of the wall surface grazes the current field of vision.
<li>An unwanted cell propagation may occur due to round-off error when an
end-point of a portal boundry segment grazes the line of motion determined
by the way-point vector.
<li>The 3rd person camera flickers every now and then and isn't very
intelligent in its positioning scheme.
<li>The rule that cell polygons always be convex was sometimes violated in map design
and this came back to bite me.  Note that this is a bug in the data,
not in the program logic.
<li>Texture coordinates for the floor were imporperly calculated.
<li>There are painfully obviouse alpha blending issues agrivated by the
draw order and depth buffer testing.
<li>Wall clipping doesn't work in all situations.
<li>The floor and ceiling textures need mip-mapping.
<li>Another map data bug is arrises when an already drawn cell is
visible from another perspective.  This arrises only with spacial paradoxes
since in a sane world, the cell flags get reset before a cell is
re-entered recursively from another perspective.  If in an in-sane world an
attempt is made to re-enter a cell recursively, when it is already somewhere
in the call stack, then the attempt will fail due to a cell-flag check.
This phenomenon can easily be observed in the big room with pillars on level 2.
<li>There is the potential for an infinite loop in the collision detection
code.  Of course, I put in a counter so that it bails out after so many iterations
of the loop.  But this is certainly a bug.  The problem simply arrises when
an object is too fat to fit between two surfaces.  This case should be detected and
dealt with differently.

<p>I know there are many more bugs than this.  But that is the list for now.

<h2>Technical Design Bugs</h2>

<p>There are also many design issues with the project.  These are things
I would have done differently had I forseen the problems that did
arrise as a result of my design choices from the beginning.
I'll go over a few here that I can remember.
<li>Carving the scene into many cells and then using each to manage
a group of polygons in a local coordinate system became unmanagable and
completely impractical.  The overhead and obfuscation of the code
in coordinate system conversions
alone is enough to see it as rediculous.  A better solution would be to
store all geometries in the global coordinate system.  Then something like
a spacial partitioning matrix might be employed to manage objects on a
local level, and aide in expediting efficient collision detection.  Something
else needs to be thought of in order to solve the problem of VSD.
I believe that in pratice, the graphics display hardware
is just so fast that professional developers can get away with drawing
many things that aren't seen.  Research the use of BSP trees.
<li>It might not have been so wise to impliment the camera as an entity.
The idea was that by making the camera a type of entity it would inhereit
all of the functionality required to navigate the scene graph and thereby
automatically handle collision detection issues with the camera.  This
actually happened to work out great, but by being an entity itself, this
also restricted the camera too in what it could do.  But this may have
more to do with my entity implimentation, and less with the idea of making
the camera a type of entity.  An obvious flaw in the camera design leads
us back to the first design flaw mentioned, and that is its only option of using tethers
to locate its position with respect to the subject entity (the entity
being filmed by the camera), because of the use of such a heavily
partitioned scene graph.  This and the
resulting ubiquitous local coordinate systems
made the camera orientation code unnecessarily complex.
<li>The scheme for describing maps that the map loader could process to
allocate and link the scene graph wasn't all that bad of an idea, but
still impratical without a peice of map designing software to aide in
development.  It would have been a good idea to think through the file
format of a map and write a map designer for the program.  Had I spent the
time to do this, it would have saved me a lot more time in the long run.
Also, much larger and more ellaborate maps may have been created.  Another
bonus is that the map designer could have done much of the preprocessing
of the static map surfaces so that the game program wouldn't have to do it during
loading of the map.  This
includes making sure all polygon vertices are ordered correctly, calculating
polygon surface normals, calculating polygon texture coordinates, etc.
The environement is mostly static.  Something could have been thought of
in dealing with the few dynamic components of the environment that there were.
<li>A terrible design flaw is found in the implimentation of doors.
There are two door objects for every logical door.  The logical door state
was kept by both objects and had to be mirrored between them when it was
changed via any one of the objects.  So they had to be aware of one another,
but the bigger bummer is the rediculous redundancy that needed to be maintained
and the potential for bugs it created.  A fix to this design flaw, I think,
is a fix to the internal representation of the scene graph so that there
is only one edge between any pair of adjacent cells.  This, however, does present
some problems of its own which, for brevity, I will neglect to mention here.
<li>Dynamic cell mode made the program unnecessarily complex.  In future versions
of a program like this, I think that the idea of providing the feature of
spacial paradoxes can be done away with.  In that case, there is no need to
complicate things or make the program slower with dynamic cell position and
orientation calculations.  These had to be performed, not only in the draw code,
but any algorithm operating upon the scene graph that needed to process vertex data.
<li>It may have been a good idea to create the construct object as an
abstract base class for all objects in the scene graph.  There really is a
good reason for it not being so in the program's current implimentation.
It's because the construct object is used strictly for describing a map that
has yet to be realized by the program.  But having a common base class for
all constructs in the program might have aided in the object oriented design
of the program and the algorithms it employed.<p>
