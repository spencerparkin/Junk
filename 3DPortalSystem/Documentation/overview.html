<h1>A brief Overview of the Project</h1>
The program consists of 5 significant "systems" (if you will).  They are...<p>
<li>The graph system,
<li>The entity system,
<li>The artifact system, 
<li>The tether system, and
<li>The texture management system.

<p>Other, less signifcant, parts of the software are
implimented in many different modules that are not
worth mentioning here.  (The program as a whole is
considered to be a portal system for reasons which
will hopefully become apparent.)  A brief explination of
each of these systems now follows.<p>

<h2>The graph system</h2>

The program uses a graph to represent the scene.
The nodes of this graph are called cells (and may
be thought of as rooms), and the edges are called
portals (which may be thought of as door-ways).
A cell consists of a list of surfaces which
topologically form a
convex polygon in the XY-plane.  (Surfaces are
described by a line segment in the XY-plane, but
are drawn from a 3 dimensional perspective as 
rectangular polygons by
extruding them along the Z-axis.)
The basic types of surfaces are walls and portals.  The graph is
directed, and as such, allows bidirectional travel between
adjacent cells by requiring two directed edges
for every logical edge or edge in the corresponding
undirected graph of the actual scene graph generated
by the program.  The direction of an edge indicates
the ability to travel from the cell containing the edge
to the adjacent cell pointed to by the edge.  More information
about how the graph is internally represented and
processed is given <a href="graph_data.html">here</a> and
<a href="graph_algo.html">here</a>, respectively.  But
don't read that yet until you've finished this page.<p>

In the terminology used by the program code, an
edge is synonymous with a portal, and a portal is
a type of surface.  A "Surface" class is provided that
impliments the support for visibility testing
against given FOVIs (Fields Of VIsion).  Then the "Wall" and
"Portal" classes are derived from this, and provide
their own virtual overloads of the methods that
handle collision detection and rendering.  Walls are
obviously written to be coporial objects, while
portals allow entities to pass through them.  Walls
render their surface geometry, while portals recursively call
the scene rendering algorithm into the adjacent
cell after having properly clipped the current FOVI
against what part of it
intersected the portal's boundry.  The complete list
of surfaces defined by the program is...<p>

<li>Walls -- These are drawn with a texture if visible.
The wall texture may stretch or wrap, and the wall geometry
may be clipped against the current field of vision.
<li>Wall Switches -- These are a type of wall with two
alternating textures.  The textures are swapped when an entity
acts on this type of surface.  One texture is usually of an
on switch, while the other is of an off switch.
<li>Portals -- These indicate adjacent cells and the
window with which they are visible from the occupied cell.
<li>Doors -- These are a special type of portal object
that act like portals in the open state, and act like
walls in the closed state.

<h2>The entity system</h2>

An entity is an agent (human or computer controlled)
that is capable of traversing the
scene graph and has built into it the functionality of collision
detection and VED (Visible Entity Determination).
Objects that derive from the "Entity"
class thereby inherit this functionality.  Entity
methods are provided for repositioning and reorienting
the entity that hide the details of confining the
entity to the currently occupied cell, or propagating
the entity to an adjacent cell if a portal boundry
is crossed.  Entity's also have the ability to
see other entity's through the use of the same
basic algorithm employed by the VSD code
used to render the scene from
the camera's perspective.  The types of entities
defined in the program include...<p>

<li>The camera -- This is used to draw the scene from various
locations and angles in the XY-plane.
<li>Spencer -- This is an entity representing the main
character who goes around manipulating the environment.
<li>Snowman -- This is an annoying entity that homes in
on Spencer entities when visible.
<li>Blob -- This is yet another annoying entity that persistantly
homes in on Spencer entities after once being visible.
This is achieved through the use of the tether system.
Two good stratagies for dealing with blobs are confining
them in rooms (they are not programmed to open doors) and
using a teleport.

<p>Only one instance of the "Spencer" class is ever
instantiated.  This is also the case with the "Camera"
class.  However, many instances of computer controlled
classes, ("Blob" objects and "Snowman" objects), are
created, and could be programmed to do anything a
user controlled entity might do, since they share
the same methods of the "Entity" base class.

<h2>The artifact system</h2>

Aftifacts are collectable objects that reside in cells
of the scene graph.  They may be collected by entities
and used on surfaces, entities, or other artifacts
if programmed to do so.  The types of atifacts defined
in the program are...<p>

<li>Keys -- These are used to unlock doors.
<li>Healthpacks -- These are used to rejuvinate health.
<li>Orbs -- These are collected at the end of a level.
<li>Teleports -- These warp an entity from somewhere in
the scene graph to somewhere else in the scene graph.
Doing so destroys any established tethers connected to
the given entity.  Tethers are explained in the next section below.

<p>Unlike entities, artifacts do not traverse the
scene graph.  They just sit around in their initially
occupied cell, waiting to be collected or acted upon.
They rotate in space or do some other attention grabbing
animation.

<h2>The tether system</h2>

Tethers are used to create a logical and determinable
path through the scene graph from one entity to
another.  It is internally represented by a list of
cells assumed to be adjacent.  This assumption is
justified by the tether's creation and maintenance
algorithms.  A path consisting of a sequence of portals 
through the scene graph may then be determined by the
tether's cell list for use by the program.  Keeping a cell
list instead of a sequence of portals was chosen for
implimentation specific reasons, but suffice it
to say, it is less information to keep track of and
easier to maintain than a bunch of portals in a directed graph
supporting bidirection travel between any two adjacent nodes.
Tethers are maintained by updating all tethers connected to an
entity when it generates a cell propagation.  (That is,
when an entity crosses a portal boundry, thereby leaving
one cell and entering another.)  At this point
a cell is either inserted or removed from the tether's
cell list at one end of it.  Notice that this list is being used as
a double-ended queue, since one end of it is processed
by one of the two entities connected by the tether.
The tether system is smart enough to detect cycles in
the tether path and remove them as soon as they are created.
This does not insure that the shortest path between the
two given entities is always maintained, but it does prevent
paths from becomming infinitely long in a
scene graph that may contain cycles.  Initially created
paths are guarenteed to be the shortest, however, by the
algorithm that establishes them between two given entities.
More on this can be find <a href="graph_algo.html">here</a>.

<h2>The texture management system.</h2>

This is a big part of the program.  I originally did not plan
on providing texture support.  But in playing around with it,
I realized that it added too much to the scene to not be used.
Without textures, it's much-much easier to see that this
program just displays a bunch of boringly placed polygons.
The texture manager
is responsible for the loading, managing, and unloading of
texture memory and providing a convenient way to map textures
to polygons.  The texture manager also keeps track of
texture usage for calculating texture priority, and midigates
texture resources.  That is, multiple requests for the same
texture memory does not create multiple copies of the same
texture objects.  Rather, texture resources are shared by
clients of the texture manager.  When it is indicated by each and every one
of these clients that a given texture object is no longer
needed, its resources are freed.  The texture manager was
written with the idea of supporting multiple image formats
in mind, but currently the only one support is 24-bit TIF files.
Support for other image formats is easy to add to the texture
manager, if needed.<p>
