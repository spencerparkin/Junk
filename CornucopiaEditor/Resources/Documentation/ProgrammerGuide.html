		<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
		
		<p>
		Cornucopia is a file system persistent data-structure in the form of a tree consistening of nodes, where each
		node in the tree takes on any one of a number of pre-defined types.  The core Cornucopia library defines a
		number of built-in node types, and allows users of the library to extend it by defining their own types, and
		even overriding pre-existing types.
		It is important to realize that the library does not scale in the size of these trees.  That is, the core library
		and its users, such as the Cornucopia Editor, were not meant to handle very large trees.  Being trees of a moderate
		size that a human being wouldn't mind exploring in an exhaustive search to completion, the algorithms in Cornucopia
		and the Cornucopia Editor are often linear in the number of nodes contained in any such tree.  The tree data-structure
		is used as nothing more than a hierarchical organization device for moderately sized chunks of human-structured data.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Cornucopia was concieved as a data-driven replacement for, and over-all design improvement of, the author's initial
		attempt to roll out a set of file formats, the instances of which to be authored by artists and processed by
		pipeline tools, all within a production environment.  Unlike the original system, Cornucopia does a much
		better job of providing maintainability of the file formats while also minimizing any potential workflow impediments to artists
		working on Cornucopia files.  By this it is meant that a Cornucopia file format can be modified while artists,
		unaware of any underlying changes, continue to author content.  Though file format changes don't happen that often,
		they do happen, and in such cases, there needs to be a plan for upgrading all existing content.  More on this is
		discussed later on.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Software Design and Implementation</h2>
		
		<p>
		Another improvement in Cornucopia over the original system is its modular design.  A major flaw in the original
		system's design was its unfortunate and unintentional need for code duplication between tools that process
		instances of the file format.  This clearly hinders software maintainability and promotes bugs.  The following
		diagram illustrates Cornucopia's simple, modular design.

		Adjacent boxes represent static linking, while solid arrows represent implicit dynamic linking.
		The dashed arrow represents explicit dynamic linking.  It is important that the Cornucopia Editor
		and its plugins both dynamically link against the core Cornucopia library, so that only one copy
		of the Lua virtual machine be resident in the process's address space.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Utilizing plugins for extended functionality, the Cornucopia Editor program itself can maintain a
		simple design that doesn't need knowledge of specific external systems.  A source control plugin
		can add its own functionality to the Cornucopia Editor's interface for dealing with the tasks of
		checking files in and out of a central repository.  Another plugin can be written that communicates
		with the game engine to provide live-authoring capabilities.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Also linked with the core Cornucopia library is a command-line tool that can be used by the build
		system to process authored content and turn it into game-engine ready data.  The core Cornucopia
		library acts as an abstraction layer between tools, (such as the editor and command-line tool), and
		the file system.  As such, it houses the ability to read Cornucopia trees into memory from
		disk and write them to the file system.  Once in memory, a tool has access to the tree in the form
		of instances of C++ classes, each of which being a derivative, directly or indirectly, of the
		Cornucopia base class for all nodes.  This base class is not abstract, as by itself it is useful
		as a grouping node.  All nodes, therefore, can act as grouping nodes -- nodes that logically
		group a collection of other nodes under a reasonable category.  The Cornucopia Editor uses
		this organizational scheme to present its data to the user in a human-friendly way.  The command-line
		tool, on the other-hand, would not care, and simply examine the data, (key-value pairs, more or less),
		in each node to produce its results.
