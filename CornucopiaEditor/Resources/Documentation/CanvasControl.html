		<p>
		The Canvas Control is a window into 3D space that is used by many node control panel interfaces,
		such as the VectorE3GANode and the BivectorE3GANode, to name a few.  The mode (3D or 2D) should
		be clear from what is being displayed and the nature of the node that it is being used to help manipulate.
		Holding the left mouse button down and dragging should allow you to rotate (in 3D) or pan (in 2D).
		In either mode, if the ALT key is down while doing this, this allows you to zoom in and out.
		Typically, a node control panel will require the CTRL key to be down in the event that a mouse
		click and drag perform a manipulation of the data being edited, in part, by the Canvas Control.
