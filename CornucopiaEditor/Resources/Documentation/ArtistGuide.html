		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<p>
		This guide attempts to cover everything a user of the Cornucopia Editor needs to know from the artist's perspective.
		The Cornucopia Editor tool provides features for both the artist and programmer user groups; so it's important to know
		which features are most applicable to you, and which features you may not need to worry about.
		</p>
		
		<h2>User Interface Components</h2>
		
		<p>
		Let us begin with an overview of the user-interface components you'll encounter most often while
		using the program in a typical work-flow.  Following is the file menu.

		<p>
		Here, the "New Tree" option creates a new blank Cornucopia tree.  At the time of this writing, there is no
		need for an artist to ever create a new tree.  The "Clone Tree" option, on the other hand, would be your
		starting point for creating a new file with new authored content.  The "Open Tree" option would be used to
		open an existing file that you have already created.  While making changes to a file, you will periodically want
		to use the "Save Tree" option to save your current edits to disk.  A tool-bar, (not shown), is also provided that provides
		quick access to these options.  You can ignore the "Upgrade Trees" option.  It is used by programmers to
		perform upgrades of content files.

		<p>Enter the undo/redo and search tool-bars.</p>

		<p>The buttons on undo/redo tool-bar, (the left and right arrows), can be used to perform full undo and redo,
		respectively, of any edit operation you perform within the Editor.  The search tool-bar can be used to find
		items by name in the main window of the editor.  Wild-card searches are supported.  A search begins after
		any currently selected item or from the beginning if nothing is selected.
