		<p>
		The VectorE3GANode represents a vector taken from a geometric algegra (GA) generated
		by a 3-dimensional euclidean vector space.  Vectors are characterized by their length
		and the direction they point, but not their position in space.  The position being arbitrary, we
		therefore draw such vectors at the origin as shown in the following screen-shot of
		the VectorE3GANode's control panel interface.

		<p>
		VectorE3GANodes are most often used to represent velocities and positions.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The VectorE3GA's control panel interface (shown above) is designed to manipulate a
		vector using polar coordinates.  The maximum magnitude of the vector can be set
		using the data view control that is only available in the docking style interface
		of the Cornucopia Editor.
