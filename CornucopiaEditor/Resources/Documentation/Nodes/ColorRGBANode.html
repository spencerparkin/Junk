		<p>
		The ColorRGBANode, as I'm sure you can guess, simply represents a color with transparency (alpha).
		The color is encoded as a mixture of the colors red, green and blue, each in the unit-interval [0,1].
		The alpha component is also in the range [0,1].  The zero would indicate an absense of that color,
		while one would indicate a fullness of that color.  Zero alpha would mean completely transparent
		while one alpha would mean completely opaque.

		The node control panel interface to the ColorRGBANode (shown above) can be used to
		choose the desired color.  Alpha is controlled by the slider, and the color can be
		chosen by pushing the button.  Doing so gives the color picker dialog below.

		This lets you also choose the desired color as a combination of hue, saturation and luminance.

		At the time of this writing, there is no feedback in the interface for the alpha component.
