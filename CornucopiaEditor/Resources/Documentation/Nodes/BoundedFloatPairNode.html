		<p>
		The BoundedFloatPairNode represents a pair of double precision floating-point values (x,y),
		with x <= y, and each contained with the compact interval [a,b].  (i.e., we have a <= x <= y <= b.)
		The slider (shown below) has a range determined by the interval [a,b].  The shaded sub-region
		of the slider represents the sub-interval [x,y].
		</p>

		<p>
		The knob shown above will control the y-value.  To control the x-value, make sure that the slider
		control has focus (click on the knob without sliding it), then push the LEFT arrow key.  This will
		move the knob to the other side of the shaded sub-region (see below).
		</p>

		<p>
		You can now use the slider to control the x-value.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The x and y values can also be entered using the left and right text boxes, respectively, shown in either of the pictures
		above.  If the x-value entered is not in [a,y], it will be clamped to the nearest end-point.  Similarly,
		if the y-value entered is not in [x,b], it will also be clamped to the nearest end-point.
