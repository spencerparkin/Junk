		<p>
		Like vectors, bivectors are elements of a geometric algebra (GA).  The BivectorE3GANode represents
		a bivector taken from the GA generated by a 3-dimensional euclidean vector space, which GA is often
		abreviated E3GA.  Such bivectors
		are always blades and can be characterized as oriented peices of area.  The position and shape of this
		area are arbitrary, but the orientation (the attitude of the plane containing the area) and handedness
		(the winding direction of the area that has been arbitrarily drawn as a circle) of the bivector are not.
		Analogous to the length of a vector is the area of a bivector.
		Typical uses of the bivector of E3GA include the incoding of rotations and angular velocities.

		<p>
		You'll notice that the BivectorE3GANode's control panel interface (shown above) is the very same
		interface provided for the <a href="VectorE3GANode.html">VectorE3GANode</a>.
		This works, because the vectors and bivectors of E3GA are simply duals of one another.
		The interface simply manipulates a dual of the bivector, which is a vector.
