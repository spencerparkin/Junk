		<p>
		The BoundedFloatNode represents a double precision floating-point number contained within a compact sub-interval [a,b]
		of the real number line.
		The real numeber 'a' is the lower bound.  The real number 'b' is the upper bound.  Each of these can be set using
		the data view control of the docking style interface.  The floating-point number is controlled by the slider below.
		</p>

		<p>
		The range of the slider is exactly that of the compact interval [a,b].  You can also enter your own values
		for the floating-point number using the text box left of the slider.  If the value entered is outside of
		the interval [a,b], it will get clamped to the nearest end-point.
